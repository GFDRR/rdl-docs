The schema specifies which type of analysis and data methodology that has generated the dataset. It supports either simulated probabilistic scenarios and empirical observations. If the dataset has been produced for a specific location, such a city, the name of the location can be included.

<summary><b>4.Vulnerability attributes</b></summary><br>

The vulnerability schema includes physical fragility and vulnerability relationships in relation to specific hazards or for multi-hazard.
The schema distinguishes key information describing the function, including: 
- function type (i.e fragility, vulnerability, damage-to-loss); 
- ountries the function was developed for, measured in terms of to geographic relevance.
- development approach (empirical, analytical, judgement, hybrid, code-based); 
- mathematical model used (including exponential, cumulative lognormal/normal); 
- the intensity measure and asset type the function relates to; 
- loss parameter / engineering demand parameter values. 

The schema consists of three base tables (_f\_core_, _f\_specifics_, and _f\_additional_) and 
five supporting tables (_f\_scoring, damage\_scale, edp\_table, lp\_table, reference\_table_).

The **core** attributes comprises data required by a user to correctly use the function, its scientific score and its applicability.
Separate entries are made for fragility functions associated with different damage states. 
The data schema permits recording of the functional form and parameters of fragility functions, but is also flexible enough to also allow the entry of discrete forms of fragility representation, i.e. damage probability matrices (DPM).

The vulnerability schema includes physical fragility and vulnerability relationships (single and multi-hazard curves) and will be extended to include socioeconomic indicators and indexes. 
The schema distinguishes key information describing the function, including: 
- function type (i.e fragility, vulnerability, damage-to-loss); 
- development approach (empirical, analytical, judgement, hybrid, code-based); 
- mathematical model used (including exponential, cumulative lognormal/normal); 
- the intensity measure and asset type the function relates to; 
- loss parameter / engineering demand parameter values. 

It also defines the countries for which the function was developed, to provide guidance on geographic relevance when applying a function. 
All data is stored with metadata focussed on providing the information required to assess its suitably for risk modelling projects - 
including source, licence, development method, units, and hazard processes it relates to.

The schema consists of three base tables (_f\_core_, _f\_specifics_, and _f\_additional_) and 
five supporting tables (_f\_scoring, damage\_scale, edp\_table, lp\_table, reference\_table_). 
The vulnerbaility schema is linked to the _cf\_Common_ tables, which contain supports consistency across the four schema.

###Table: _mover.f\_core_

The _f\_core_ table comprises data fields for recording all necessary fragility function attributes required by a user to reproduce the function. 
It also comprises fields that contain useful information for the scoring the fragility functions (which can be recorded in the _f\_scoring_ table).

The data schema permits recording of the functional form and parameters of fragility functions, but is also flexible enough to also allow the entry of discrete forms of fragility representation, i.e. damage probability matrices (DPM).
